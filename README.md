# Propagator Examples

These are example programs built using the [propagators](https://github.com/ekmett/propagators) Haskell library. Included are some examples from Radul's PhD thesis on the topic.

* [Bidrectional addition](https://github.com/qfpl/propagator-examples/blob/master/src/Data/Propagator/Example/AdderLift2.hs)
* [Celsius-to-fahrenheit](https://github.com/qfpl/propagator-examples/blob/master/src/Data/Propagator/Example/CtoFBidirectional.hs)
* [Simplified sudoku](https://github.com/qfpl/propagator-examples/blob/master/src/Data/Propagator/Example/Sudoku4.hs)
* [A barometer, a stopwatch, and a ruler](https://github.com/qfpl/propagator-examples/blob/master/src/Data/Propagator/Example/BuildingHeight.hs)


The propagators library is an abandoned project, implementing an older version of the propagators concept. For the current experimental implementation, see [guanxi](https://github.com/ekmett/guanxi)
